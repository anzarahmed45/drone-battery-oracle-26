About This Project
The Drone Battery Oracle is a predictive model that estimates a drone's battery consumption based on various flight parameters including speed, altitude, wind conditions, payload weight, and more.
This tool helps pilots optimize their flight plans, ensure sufficient battery capacity for missions, and improve overall flight efficiency.
How It Works
Our prediction model uses a combination of physics-based formulas and machine learning techniques to estimate energy consumption based on:
Drone aerodynamics and propulsion efficiency
Environmental factors affecting flight performance
Power requirements for different flight conditions
Battery discharge characteristics
The core algorithm calculates power requirements using the formula:
P = (1/η) × (Phover + Pmovement + Pwind)
Where η is efficiency factor, Phover is power required for hovering, Pmovement is additional power for movement, and Pwind is power to overcome wind resistance.
Model Features
The model considers:
Flight Speed: Higher speeds require more power
Altitude: Higher altitudes decrease air density and propeller efficiency
